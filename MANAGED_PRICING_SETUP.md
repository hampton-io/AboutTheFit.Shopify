# Managed Pricing Setup Guide

## What is Managed Pricing?

**Managed Pricing** is a Shopify feature where:
- ‚úÖ You configure pricing plans in the Partner Dashboard
- ‚úÖ Shopify handles the billing UI and payment collection
- ‚úÖ Merchants manage subscriptions through their Shopify Admin
- ‚ùå You **cannot** create/modify subscriptions via GraphQL Billing API

## How Your App Now Works With Managed Pricing

### 1. **Subscription Sync System**
Your app automatically syncs subscription status from Shopify:

```typescript
// Called when loading billing status
await syncSubscriptionFromShopify(request);
```

**What it does:**
1. Reads the active subscription from Shopify
2. Maps the subscription name to your plan (FREE, SIDE_HUSSL, BUSINESS, ALL_IN)
3. Updates your database with correct `creditsLimit` and `productLimit`
4. Sets entitlements automatically

### 2. **UI Changes**
- **"Upgrade Plan" button** ‚Üí Shows toast message directing users to Shopify Admin
- **Billing modal** ‚Üí Displays info banner explaining how to change plans
- **No API calls** ‚Üí Doesn't try to create subscriptions (which would fail)

### 3. **How Users Change Plans**

**Merchant Flow:**
1. Merchant goes to **Shopify Admin ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí About the Fit**
2. Clicks **"Manage app"** or **"Change pricing plan"**
3. Selects a plan from your configured options
4. Shopify handles payment
5. Next time they open your app, it syncs automatically ‚úÖ

### 4. **Your Partner Dashboard Setup**

In Shopify Partner Dashboard, configure these pricing plans to match your code:

| Plan Name | Price | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Free Plan** | $0/month | 50 try-ons, 3 products |
| **Side Hussle** | $9.99/month | 500 try-ons, 100 products |
| **Business** | $39/month | 10,000 try-ons, unlimited products |
| **All In** | $99/month | Unlimited try-ons, unlimited products |

**Important:** The plan names in Partner Dashboard **must match** the names in your `PLANS` constant:
```typescript
const PLANS = {
  FREE: { name: "Free Plan", ... },
  SIDE_HUSSL: { name: "Side Hussle", ... },
  BUSINESS: { name: "Business", ... },
  ALL_IN: { name: "All In", ... },
}
```

## How It Works Behind The Scenes

### When App Loads:
```
1. User opens app
2. App calls /api/billing/status
3. syncSubscriptionFromShopify() runs
4. Reads Shopify subscription via GraphQL (READ is allowed!)
5. Maps plan name ‚Üí plan key
6. Updates database with creditsLimit & productLimit
7. Returns subscription status to UI
8. User sees their correct plan and limits ‚úÖ
```

### When User Tries To Enable A Product:
```
1. User toggles product ON
2. App checks: hasProductLimitsExceeded(shop)
3. Reads productLimit from database (set by sync)
4. If within limit ‚Üí Enable product ‚úÖ
5. If over limit ‚Üí Show "Upgrade your plan" message ‚ùå
```

### When User Clicks "Upgrade Plan":
```
1. Shows modal with plan options
2. User clicks a plan button
3. Toast message: "Go to Shopify Admin to change plans"
4. User goes to Shopify Admin
5. Changes plan through Shopify's interface
6. Returns to app
7. Sync runs ‚Üí Database updated with new limits ‚úÖ
```

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- ‚úÖ `app/services/billing.server.ts`
  - Added `syncSubscriptionFromShopify()` function
  - Reads subscription from Shopify
  - Updates database with entitlements

- ‚úÖ `app/routes/api.billing.status.tsx`
  - Calls sync before returning status
  - Ensures data is always up-to-date

### Frontend:
- ‚úÖ `app/routes/app._index.tsx`
  - Updated `handleUpgradePlan()` to show toast message
  - Added info banner in billing modal
  - No longer calls API to create subscriptions

## Environment Variables

Optional - explicitly mark as managed pricing:
```bash
SHOPIFY_MANAGED_PRICING=true
```

## Advantages of Managed Pricing

‚úÖ **Shopify handles billing UI** - Less code to maintain  
‚úÖ **Compliant with app store** - Required for some apps  
‚úÖ **Better merchant trust** - Familiar Shopify interface  
‚úÖ **Automatic payment handling** - Shopify collects payments  
‚úÖ **Built-in dunning** - Shopify handles failed payments  

## Testing

### 1. Deploy Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add managed pricing support with subscription sync"
git push
```

### 2. Configure Plans in Partner Dashboard
1. Go to Partner Dashboard ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Pricing
2. Enable Managed Pricing
3. Add 4 pricing plans (matching the names above)
4. Save

### 3. Test The Flow
1. Install app in a dev store
2. Open app ‚Üí Should show "Free Plan"
3. Go to Shopify Admin ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Your App
4. Click "Change pricing plan"
5. Select "Side Hussle" plan
6. Return to app
7. Refresh ‚Üí Should show "Side Hussle" with 100 product limit ‚úÖ

### 4. Test Product Limits
1. Try enabling products
2. Should respect the productLimit from your plan
3. At limit ‚Üí Should show upgrade message

## Troubleshooting

### Plan names don't match?
**Error:** Sync can't find plan key  
**Fix:** Ensure Partner Dashboard plan names **exactly match** your `PLANS.name` values

### Sync not working?
**Error:** Database not updating  
**Fix:** Check logs for "üîÑ Syncing subscription from Shopify"  
**Debug:** Run `/api/billing/status` and check console

### Still seeing "Managed Pricing" errors?
**Cause:** Old code trying to create subscriptions  
**Fix:** Ensure `handleUpgradePlan()` just shows toast message (doesn't call API)

## Migration from API Billing

If you previously used API-based billing:

1. ‚úÖ Sync function will read existing subscriptions
2. ‚úÖ Database will be updated with correct limits
3. ‚úÖ Users won't lose their current plans
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Future upgrades must go through Shopify Admin

## Benefits for Your App

1. **Works correctly with Managed Pricing** ‚úÖ
2. **Database stays in sync** with Shopify subscriptions
3. **Product limits enforced** properly
4. **Monthly resets work** as expected
5. **User-friendly** - clear instructions on how to change plans

Your app is now fully compatible with Shopify's Managed Pricing system! üéâ
