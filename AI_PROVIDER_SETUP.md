# AI Provider Options for Virtual Try-On

## The Problem with Gemini

**Gemini is not designed for virtual try-on.** It's an image generation model designed to create images from text descriptions, not to perform complex image-to-image transformations. This is why you often get:
- The product image returned as-is
- Inconsistent results
- Text responses instead of images

## Recommended Solution: Use Replicate

**Replicate** provides access to specialized virtual try-on models like **IDM-VTON** that are specifically trained for this task.

### Why Replicate?
- ✅ Specialized virtual try-on models
- ✅ Consistent, high-quality results
- ✅ Person identity preservation
- ✅ Realistic clothing fit
- ✅ Pay-per-use pricing (no monthly fees)
- ✅ Fast generation (usually 5-15 seconds)

### Pricing
- **~$0.01-0.05 per generation** (much cheaper and better than Gemini)
- No monthly subscription
- Free tier: $5 credit to start

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Switch to Replicate (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Get Replicate API Token
1. Sign up at https://replicate.com
2. Go to https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens
3. Create an API token

#### Step 2: Install Replicate Package
```bash
npm install replicate
```

#### Step 3: Add to Environment Variables
Add to your `.env` file:
```env
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_your_token_here
```

#### Step 4: Switch the AI Service
In `app/services/tryon.server.ts`, change the import:

**FROM:**
```typescript
import { virtualTryOnAI } from './ai.server';
```

**TO:**
```typescript
import { virtualTryOnAI } from './ai-replicate.server';
```

That's it! Now you'll get consistent, high-quality virtual try-on results.

### Option 2: Keep Gemini (Not Recommended)

If you want to stick with Gemini despite the limitations, here are ways to improve results:

#### Improve Gemini Prompt

The current prompt might be too complex. Simplify to:

```typescript
const prompt = `
Generate a photorealistic image showing the person from Image 1 wearing the clothing item from Image 2.

Requirements:
- Keep the person's face, body, and identity EXACTLY the same
- Only change the clothing to match Image 2
- Maintain same pose, lighting, and background
- Create 4 variations in a 2x2 grid
- Return ONLY the generated image, no text

CRITICAL: You must output an IMAGE file, not a text description.
`;
```

#### Accept Limitations

Be aware that Gemini will still:
- Sometimes return product images
- Have inconsistent quality
- Occasionally fail to generate
- Cost more per generation
