# Pre-Selected Model Images

Drop your model photos here! ðŸ“¸

## What to do:

1. **Add your images to this folder**
   - JPG, PNG, or WebP formats
   - Clear, front-facing photos work best
   - Good lighting and minimal background

2. **Name your files descriptively**
   - Examples: `model-alex.jpg`, `female-professional.png`, `male-casual.webp`
   - Include `male`, `female`, or `unisex` to auto-detect gender

3. **Run the setup script**
   ```bash
   npx tsx prisma/seed-canned-images.ts
   ```

That's it! Your images will appear as options in the try-on modal.

## Tips:

- Use 3-6 models for best results (too many = overwhelming)
- High resolution recommended (512x512px minimum)
- Diverse models = better customer experience
- Test each image with your products after adding
