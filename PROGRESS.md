## What's Next ðŸš§

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1-2 of TODO.md)

1. **Environment Setup** (You need to do this)
   - [ ] Get Supabase credentials
   - [ ] Get Google AI API key
   - [ ] Create `.env` file with all credentials
   - [ ] Create Supabase storage bucket `tryon-photos`

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run Database Migrations**
   ```bash
   npm run prisma migrate dev --name add_tryon_models
   npm run prisma generate
   ```

### API Routes to Build (Phase 3)

- [ ] **app/routes/api.tryon.create.tsx** - Create try-on request
- [ ] **app/routes/api.tryon.$id.tsx** - Get try-on status/result
- [ ] **app/routes/api.tryon.list.tsx** - List all try-ons for shop
- [ ] **app/routes/api.products.search.tsx** - Search products

### Frontend Components to Build (Phase 4)

- [ ] **app/routes/app._index.tsx** - Main try-on interface (replace existing)
- [ ] **app/components/ProductSelector.tsx** - Product search/selection
- [ ] **app/components/PhotoUpload.tsx** - Photo upload with preview
- [ ] **app/components/TryOnResults.tsx** - Display results in 2x2 grid
- [ ] **app/routes/app.history.tsx** - View past try-ons

### Image Generation Ready âœ…

The app uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** which can generate virtual try-on images. The AI service is ready to use once you:
1. Set up your Google AI API key
2. Create the API routes and UI
3. Test with real product images and user photos

For production optimization:
- Monitor generation quality and adjust prompts as needed
- Consider adding quality validation
- Test with various clothing types and user photos
- Monitor API costs and usage

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Set up environment variables (create .env first)
# See SETUP.md for details

# 3. Run database migration
npm run prisma migrate dev --name add_tryon_models

# 4. Generate Prisma client
npm run prisma generate

# 5. Start dev server
npm run dev
```

## Testing Checklist (After API Routes & UI)

- [ ] Can select a product from the store
- [ ] Can upload a user photo
- [ ] Photo validates correctly (size, type)
- [ ] Try-on request creates successfully
- [ ] AI generates result (or returns demo placeholder)
- [ ] Result displays in 2x2 grid
- [ ] Can view history of try-ons
- [ ] Credits decrement correctly
- [ ] Error handling works (no credits, API failure, etc.)

---

## Environment Variables Needed

Create `.env` file with:

```bash
# Shopify (auto-populated by CLI)
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=

# Database - Supabase
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://..."

# Google AI
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY="your_key_here"

# Supabase Storage
SUPABASE_URL="https://xxx.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_anon_key"

# Optional: Replicate (if using for image gen)
# REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="your_token"
```

---

## Key Design Decisions Made

1. **Database:** PostgreSQL via Supabase (scalable, managed)
2. **File Storage:** Supabase Storage (integrated, simple)
3. **AI Provider:** Google Gemini for analysis, needs image gen service
4. **Credits System:** Built-in (10 free, expandable for billing)
5. **Status Tracking:** Enum-based (PENDING â†’ PROCESSING â†’ COMPLETED/FAILED)
6. **Image Workflow:** Upload â†’ Process â†’ Store Result â†’ Display

---

## Known Limitations & Notes

1. **Background Processing Not Implemented Yet**
   - Try-on processing is synchronous (may timeout for slow AI)
   - Phase 5 in TODO.md covers adding job queue

2. **No Billing Integration Yet**
   - Credits system is ready but not connected to Shopify billing
   - Phase 6 in TODO.md covers this

3. **No Real-time Updates**
   - Client needs to poll for status updates
   - WebSocket implementation is optional (Phase 5)

---

## Next Session TODO

1. Set up environment variables (`.env`)
2. Run `npm install` to get new dependencies
3. Run `npx prisma db push` to sync schema
4. Start building API routes (begin with `api.products.search.tsx`)
5. Test product fetching with existing Shopify admin
6. Build basic product selector UI
7. Integrate photo upload
8. Connect to AI service and test image generation
