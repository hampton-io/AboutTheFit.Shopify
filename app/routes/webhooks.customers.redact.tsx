 * GDPR Compliance Webhook: Customer Data Deletion (Redaction)
 * 
 * Triggered when a customer requests deletion of their data (right to be forgotten).
 * We must delete all data associated with this customer.
 * 
 * For About The Fit:
 * - Customer photos are already deleted after processing (not permanently stored)
 * - Delete any try-on request records associated with this customer
 * - Delete any analytics or logs containing customer PII
